    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<p>Well, I'm Herbert Sizek!</p>
<p>I'm a PhD student at Indiana University studying Ecology in the Department of Biology and Complex Systems and Networks in the Department of Informatics. My research is at the intersection of Agriculture, Ecology, and Network Science focusing on how management practices and policies influence the ecologic stability of landscape. </p>
<p>You might see me around town playing old-time or Irish music on a Hammered Dulcimer. I usually play on a dulcimer made by Daniel Leroy Von Antwerp. If this name is familular, you're seeped in Dulcimer lore. The relationship to the modern dulcimer scene is that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzzygOZ9lEA">Bill Robinson's</a> first instrument (the one his dad played) was made by Von Antwerp.    </p>
<h2>Current Research Projects</h2>
<h3>Crop Rotation Modeling</h3>
<p>Crop rotations and cover crops have been touted as a mechanism to improve and maintain soil health. In the Midwest, we have seen widespread adoption of a three year crop rotation schedule, soybeans, corn, and fallow/cover crop. More complicated crop rotations have been suggested and, to an extent, tested to differing effects. However the number of crop rotation schedules is enormous and can vary in effectiveness dependent on the conditions at a specific site, such as the soil type and quality, disease concerns, hardiness zones, etc.. I'm interested in how crop rotations differ between fields and when individual fields transition between crop rotations. </p>
<h3>Agricultural Field Stability through Time</h3>
<p>Through time, individual agricultural fields can be consolidated or divided, boarders shifted slightly, depending on various whims. Our ability to track individual changes in agricultural fields is mediated through our ability to consistently segment agricultural fields. I am interested in working at this juncture of determining the differences between stability of the segmentation versus the stability of the agricultural fields. This work can both enhance our understanding of the segmentation process as well as enhance our undersanding of changes in field shape and structure.</p>
